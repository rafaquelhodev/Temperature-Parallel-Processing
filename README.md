# Temperature-Parallel-Processing
Reads .obd from Abaqus and write the temperature fields in time using parallel processing

The .odb file is the output of a transfer-heat problem solved by Abaqus. The routine .py reads the output and writes the results using parallel processing to speed up the process.
